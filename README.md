# Risk

Quick clojure program to simulate risk (the board game) attacks and defenses
and give a percentage of times an attacker will win with given numbers of
attacking and defending troops.

It assumes you will attack with maxium (3 and 2) and continue attacking until
one side has zero troops.

## Usage

The library gennerates the below table when you run (print-table).

```
 A |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |     7 |     8 |      9 |     10 |
D  |-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+--------|
1  | 41.62 | 75.68 | 91.58 | 97.22 | 98.96 | 99.57 | 99.90 | 99.97 | 100.00 | 100.00 |
2  | 10.59 | 35.35 | 65.59 | 78.87 | 88.76 | 93.45 | 96.64 | 97.91 |  99.06 |  99.35 |
3  |  2.61 | 20.80 | 47.75 | 63.41 | 77.10 | 85.25 | 91.12 | 94.50 |  96.50 |  97.81 |
4  |  0.75 |  8.94 | 32.54 | 47.01 | 63.15 | 74.42 | 83.49 | 88.74 |  93.13 |  95.61 |
5  |  0.13 |  4.95 | 20.52 | 36.56 | 50.00 | 64.20 | 73.38 | 81.96 |  87.05 |  92.16 |
6  |  0.06 |  1.85 | 13.29 | 25.04 | 39.84 | 52.05 | 63.76 | 73.02 |  81.38 |  86.31 |
7  |  0.01 |  1.25 |  8.46 | 17.80 | 29.08 | 42.12 | 54.80 | 64.39 |  73.16 |  80.07 |
8  |  0.00 |  0.44 |  5.16 | 12.00 | 22.75 | 32.96 | 44.40 | 55.78 |  64.60 |  71.95 |
9  |  0.00 |  0.33 |  3.21 |  8.78 | 16.77 | 26.13 | 35.33 | 45.61 |  55.94 |  65.16 |
10 |  0.00 |  0.11 |  2.13 |  5.80 | 11.33 | 19.89 | 29.45 | 37.87 |  47.91 |  56.82 |
